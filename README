BASIC INSTALLATION AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Requirements: perl, DBD::Mysql perl module, MySQL 4.1 or newer.
  php4, php4-mysql extension, PEAR::DB() for web frontend

- Create /space, put scripts under /space/scripts, edit ds.pm, tinderbox.ph,
  setup MySQL database
- Initialize the Tinderbox: cd /space/scripts && ./tc init
- Setup NFS server with this in /etc/exports:
  /space  -ro -alldirs -maproot=0:0 localhost
  If your /space is a symlink, export real filesystem's mount point
- Create new jail using create_new_jail
- Create new ports tree using create_portstree
- Create new build using create_new_build

To update an existing jail:
- mkjail

To run a build of a port:
- tc addPort -b <buildname> -d <port directory> -r
- tinderbuild -b <buildname> <port directory>

tinderbuild options:
-init will call mkjail then mkbuild
-cleanpackages will remove all packages already built for the given build.
-updateports will update the build's portstree (dangerous if doing multiple
  parallel runs)
-skipmake skips the Makefile generation stage if a good Makefile already exists
-noduds skip duds file generation (packages which are forbidden or ignored will
  be built)

Getting a copy of work directory for failed build:
- touch .keep file into port directory
- make sure directory /space/wrkdirs/<build_name> exists
  Tarred work directory for the build will appear there.

USING CCACHE WITH TINDERBOX BUILDS

To use ccache support, you must first create a tar file with ccache and various
symlinks within a /opt directory.  Your tarball contents should be:

opt
opt/ccache
opt/gcc -> ccache
opt/cc -> ccache
opt/g++ -> ccache
opt/c++ -> ccache

This tarball must be called ccache.tar, and be placed in the jail directory
for each jail that will use ccache (e.g. /space/jails/5-STABLE).

Once the tarball is created, add:

CCACHE_ENABLED=1
CCACHE_DIR=/ccache
CCACHE_NOLINK=1
CCACHE_MAX_SIZE=2G
 G=GB M=MB K=KB, default is 1GB

To your rawenv file.  Then run your builds as you normally would.  To debug
ccache, add the following to rawenv:

CCACHE_LOGFILE=/ccache.log

Then, in the root of each build directory, there will be a ccache.log that
will let you know if the cache is working.
