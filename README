BASIC INSTALLATION AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Obtaining Tinderbox:
--------------------

The latest release of Tinderbox can be downloaded from
http://tinderbox.marcuscom.com.

Tinderbox lives in MarcusCom CVS repository under ``portstools'' module.

http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/

Requirements:
-------------

Recent FreeBSD (development happens on -CURRENT only, but Tindebox is known
to work on RELENG_5 and RELENG_6 too), Perl 5.8 or later (lang/perl5.8),
DBD::Mysql Perl module (databases/p5-DBD-mysql41), and MySQL 4.1 or later
(databases/mysql41-server).

The web front-ends require php4 (lang/php4), php4-mysql extension
(databases/php4-mysql), and PEAR::DB (databases/pear-DB).

The standard web front-end (found in the ``www'' subdirectory) requires you
have "register_globals=on" in your php.ini.  The experimental web front-end
(found in the ``www-exp'' subdirectory) does not require register_globals
to be on, but does require the php4-session extension (www/php4-session).

Installation:
-------------

By default, Tinderbox expects to do all of its work in /space.  This is
completely configurable, however.  Hence forth, /space will be referred to
as ${pb} (think: package build).  If you are using an alternative Tinderbox
root, just substitute ${pb} with that root directory.

1. Create directories ${pb} and ${pb}/scripts.

2. Extract the Tinderbox distribution into ${pb}/scripts.

3. Edit ds.ph and tinderbox.ph for your setup (if you are using the standard
   web front-end, also edit www/inc_ds.php).

4. Create the database and database user on the host that you defined within
   ds.ph.  Note: the database can live on the same server as Tinderbox.  Just
   set $DB_HOST to localhost in ds.ph.  The Tinderbox user must be granted
   the following permissions on the Tinderbox database (for security purposes
   no other permissions should be granted):

Select_priv
Insert_priv
Update_priv
Delete_priv

5. Populate the database with the Tinderbox schema:

mysql -uroot -p -h {$DB_HOST} {$DB_NAME} < tinderbox.schema

   Where {$DB_HOST} and {$DB_NAME} are the values of $DB_HOST and $DB_NAME
   from ds.ph respectively.  Note: do not do this if you are upgrading!
   If you do, you will overwrite all of your previous data.  If schema changes
   are required for upgrading, a separate upgrade schema file will be
   included, and instructions will be available at
   http://tinderbox.marcuscom.com.

6. Initialize the Tinderbox:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc init

7. Tinderbox can use either NFS or nullfs to mount the required file systems
   within the build chroots (called Builds in Tinderbox).  If you wish to use
   nullfs, skip to step 10.

8. Setup the Tinderbox server as an NFS server by adding the following to
   /etc/exports:

${pb} -ro -alldirs -maproot=0:0 localhost

   Note: ${pb} _CANNOT_ be a symlink.  It should be a real, fully-qualified
   path.

9. Add the following to /etc/rc.conf to enable the NFS client and server:

nfs_client_enable="YES"
nfs_server_flags="-u -t -n 20"
rpcbind_enable="YES"
nfs_server_enable="YES"
nfs_reserved_port_only="YES"

10. Create the required Jails using the ${pb}/scripts/create
    command.  A Jail is nothing more than a version of FreeBSD.  For example,
    to create a jail for FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./create Jail -n 5.4 -d "FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE" \
	-t RELENG_5_4_0_RELEASE -u NONE

    Note: all Jail names _MUST_ begin with their FreeBSD major version number.
    That is, the following is an illegal jail name: ``FreeBSD-5.4''.

11. Create the required PortsTrees using the ${pb}/scripts/create
    command.  A PortsTree is a set of ports you wish to build.  A PortsTree
    does not have to be a complete FreeBSD ports tree.  However, all ports
    within a tree must have all of their dependencies within the same tree.

    For example, to create a portstree that tracks the full FreeBSD ports
    tree:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./create PortsTree -n FreeBSD \
	-d "FreeBSD ports tree" -w http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/

12. Create the required Builds using the ${pb}/scripts/create
    command.  A Build is a combination of a Jail and a PortsTree.  The
    build is the object in which packages are created.  To create a build
    that combines a 5.4-RELEASE Jail with the FreeBSD ports tree:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./create Build -n 5.4-FreeBSD -j 5.4 -p FreeBSD \
	-d "5.4-RELEASE with FreeBSD ports tree"

    Note: the recommended way to name Builds is ``Jail-PortsTree''.  All builds
    must also begin with their FreeBSD major version number.


NOTE: The create script uses cvsup12 as their default cvsup mirror.
If you would like to use another server, or enable cvsup compression use
the -H and -C command line arguments to the create_new_* scripts respectively.
For example, to use cvsup2.freebsd.org and enable cvsup compression for
all Jail updates, use the following command:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./create Jail -n 5-STABLE -d "FreeBSD 5-STABLE" \
	-t RELENG_5 -u CVSUP -C -H cvsup2.freebsd.org

Using Tinderbox:
----------------

To run a Tinderbox build, and track the progress in the database, you must
first add the port you wish to build to the database using the
${pb}/scripts/tc application:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addPort -b {BUILD} -d {PORT DIRECTORY} -r

Where {BUILD} is the name of the Build for which this port should be built,
and {PORT DIRECTORY} is the directory within the PortsTree where this port
can be found.  For example, to build the GNOME 2 Desktop port for the
Build ``5.4-FreeBSD'':

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addPort -b 5.4-FreeBSD -d x11/gnome2 -r

Note: a port does not have to be added to the database for Tinderbox to
build it.  If you just want to do a quick ad hoc port build, forgo the
previously mentioned step.

To start a Tinderbox build, use the ${pb}/scripts/tinderbuild command:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tinderbuild -b {BUILD} {PORT DIRECTORY}

For example, to build the GNOME 2 Desktop for the Build 5.4-FreeBSD:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tinderbuild -b 5.4-FreeBSD x11/gnome2

TIP: The example above will run the build in the foreground with all messages
and errors echoing to the terminal.  To capture all of this,  it is
recommended to redirect tinderbuild output to a log file.  For example:

Bourne shell equivalents:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tinderbuild -b 5.4-FreeBSD x11/gnome2 \
	> ${pb}/builds/5.4-FreeBSD/build.log 2>&1 &

C shell equivalents:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tinderbuild -b 5.4-FreeBSD x11/gnome2 \
	>& ${pb}/builds/5.4-FreeBSD/build.log &

The tinderbuild script also accepts some additional command line arguments:

 -init 		: updates the Jail then updates the Build
 -cleanpackages : removes all packages already built for the specified Build
 -updateports 	: updates the Build's PortsTree (NOTE: dangerous if doing
                  parallel runs with the same PortsTree)
 -skipmake 	: skips the Makefile generation stage (NOTE: only use this
                  option if a good Makefile already exists)
 -noduds	: skips the duds file generation stage (NOTE: packages which
                  are forbidden or ignored will be built)

Maintenance:
------------

To update existing Jails, use the ${pb}/scripts/mkjail command.  For example:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./mkjail 5.4

To update existing PortsTrees, use the ``tc'' (Tinderbox Controller)
application with the ``updatePortsTree'' command.  For example:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc updatePortsTree -p FreeBSD

Over time, Builds may become cluttered with old log files and packages.  To
cleanup old, unreferenced, files, use the ${pb}/scripts/tc application
with the ``tbcleanup'' command:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tbcleanup

Troubleshooting:
----------------

If you encounter problems with Tinderbox, it helps to see what is going
on inside a Build.  Tinderbox operational logs can be found under
${pb}/builds/{BUILD} (where {BUILD} is the Build name).  This is where
tinderbuild output should be redirected (see ``Using Tinderbox'' above).
The make.0 and make.1 logs contain the initial build setup for each port.
The reason there are two logs is that tinderbuild runs in two phases.
The second build phase is identical to the first, and is run to catch
any transient problems that may have occurred in the first phase.

The full build log of each port will be copied to ${pb}/logs/{BUILD}
(where {BUILD} is the Build name).  If the port failed to build successfully,
the log will also be copied to ${pb}/errors/{BUILD} (where {BUILD} is the
Build name).

Sometimes, the log alone is not sufficient for figuring out
why a port failed to build.  In such cases, one must also see the port's
work directory.  To have Tinderbox save this, create an empty file called
``.keep'' in the port's directory, and the work directory will be tarred,
compressed, and copied to ${pb}/wrkdirs/{BUILD} (where {BUILD} is the
Build name).

==============================================================================

ADVANCED TOPICS

Alternative Mounting:
---------------------

If you want to mount /ports inside your PortsTree or /src inside your Jail
via nullfs or NFS from another location, use -m switch to create.

Example for NFS:

  ./create PortsTree -n FreeBSD -m server:/directory
  ./create Jail -n 6-FreeBSD -m server:/directory

Example for nullfs:

  ./create PortsTree -n FreeBSD -m /directory
  ./create Jail -n 6-FreeBSD -m /directory

Tinderbuild will ensure that these file systems are correctly mounted so you do
not need to mount them by your own before calling tinderbuild.

If you want to change this settings later, use:

  ./tc setPortsMount -p <portstreename> -m <mount path>
  ./tc setSrcMount -j <jailname> -m <mount path>

Distfile Caching:
-----------------

Caching distfiles in a local repository can greatly improve build times.
As long as there is sufficient disk space, enabling a local (or NFS)
distfile cache is easy.  Just use the following command:

  ./tc configDistfile -c <mount point>

Where <mount point> is either an NFS specification, or fully qualified path
(in the case of nullfs) in which to store downloaded distfiles.  For example:

NFS:

  ./tc configDistfile -c localhost:/space/distfiles

nullfs:

  ./tc configDistfile -c /d/distfiles

Using Ccache:
-------------

Another excellent way of accelerating builds is to use the compiler cache,
``ccache''.  To use ccache support, you must first create a tar file with
ccache and various symlinks within a /opt directory.  Your tarball contents
should be:

opt
opt/ccache
opt/gcc -> ccache
opt/cc -> ccache
opt/g++ -> ccache
opt/c++ -> ccache

This tarball must be called ccache.tar, and be placed in the Jail directory
for each Jail that will use ccache (e.g. ${pb}/jails/5.4).

Once the tarball is created, run (-e for enabling, -d for disabling,
-c specifies directory, -s maximal size):

  ./tc configCcache -e -c /ccache -s 2G

Then run your builds as you normally would.  To debug ccache, add -l /ccache.log
switch to the command.

Then, in the root of each build directory, there will be a ccache.log that
will let you know if the cache is working.

Automating/Queuing Port Builds:
-------------------------------

If you want to use tinderbox to test many different ports one after the other
you probably want ``tinderd''. tinderd runs as a daemon and looks to see if
something was added to the ``ports to build queue''. You can add different
ports for different builds for different hosts with different priorities.
tinderd will automatically pick up the port with the highest priority for its
host and starts building it. That repeats until the queue is empty. After
the queue empties tinderd will sleep for a configurable amount of time
(default: 120 seconds) thereafter it starts searching for new queue entries
again.

To set it up you must first add a Tinderbox host to the database:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addHost

Right after that you can start tinderd (it will stay in foreground by default).
Now use:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addBuildPortsQueueEntry -b {BUILD} \
	-d {PORT DIRECTORY}

To add a port to the queue. tinderd will automatically pick it up, run a
tinderbuild on it, and will delete the entry after tinderbuild completed.
(Where {BUILD} is a Build name, and {PORT DIRECTORY} is a directory under
{BUILDS}'s PortsTree (e.g. x11/gnome2).)

NOTE: You must be running the ``www-exp'' web front-end to take advantage
of the following.

To use tinderd scheduling via the web you must first create a User:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addUser -n {USER} -e {EMAIL} -p {PASSWORD} -w

(Where {USER} is a username, {EMAIL} is the user's email address,
and {PASSWORD} is the user's password for Tinderbox web access.)

If you want to enable web access for a previously created user, you must
update that user's account to give them a password as well as web access:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc updateUser -n {USER} -e {EMAIL} -p {PASSWORD} -w

(Where {USER} is a username, {EMAIL} is the user's email address,
and {PASSWORD} is the user's password for Tinderbox web access.)

Then you have to define one web administrator who has full rights on
all Hosts/Builds and is the only account that can add other users:

# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc setWwwAdmin -u {USER}

(Where {USER} is the web administrator's username.)

After that, just browse to the Tinderbox web site with your web browser and
login with {USER} and {PASSWORD}. You can now create and modify other
users easily by using the "Add User" or "Modify User" links.
