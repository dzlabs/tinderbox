Tinderbox User Guide

   Tinderbox is a package building system for FreeBSD ports, based
   on official Portbuild scripts used on pointyhat building
   cluster. Tinderbox was written by Joe Marcus Clarke.

   You can define multiple jails (base system versions) and
   multiple portstrees. The combination of jail and portstree is
   called a build. A Tinderbox jail is not what is understood as a
   jail in FreeBSD, it is in fact a given world in a chroot.
   Tinderbox supports automatic tracking of dependencies and only
   rebuilds packages that changed since last run. Tinderbox has
   support for email notification of failed builds. Tinderbox also
   integrates well with ccache.

   Tinderbox is designed to easily provide package sets of ports
   you need, for platforms and architectures you need. Tinderbox
   is also excellent tool for testing new ports and port upgrades,
   especially for testing dependencies and packing lists. It's
   also useful for testing ports on various releases of FreeBSD,
   since you can run FreeBSD 7.X/8.X world as a jail on a FreeBSD
   9.X host.

   on one page.

Chapter 1. Obtaining Tinderbox

   The latest release of Tinderbox can be downloaded from
   http://tinderbox.marcuscom.com.

   Tinderbox lives in the MarcusCom CVS repository under the
   "portstools" module.

   http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/

   Two ports exist:

     * ports-mgmt/tinderbox which tracks the latest stable release
       (plus sometimes back-ported fixes from the STABLE branch)
     * ports-mgmt/tinderbox-devel which tracks HEAD and might
       contain additional experimental patches not (yet) present
       in the CVS.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Requirements

   Recent FreeBSD (development happens on 9-CURRENT only, but
   Tinderbox is known to work on RELENG_7 and RELENG_8 too), Perl
   5.8 or later (lang/perl5.8), and either MySQL 4.1 or later
   (databases/mysql41-server) or PostgreSQL 7.4 or later
   (databases/postgres74-server).

   If MySQL is used, the MySQL Perl module must also be installed
   (databases/p5-DBD-mysql41). If PostgreSQL is used, the Pg Perl
   module must also be installed (databases/p5-DBD-Pg).

   Please note, however, that is is recommended that either MySQL
   5.0 or PostgreSQL 8.1 (or later) be used. There are currently
   no plans to make this a requirement, but it may happen in the
   future.

   PHP 4.x is now EOL, so the web front-end (found in the webui/
   subdirectory) requires PHP 5 (lang/php5),
   PEAR::MDB2_Driver_mysql (databases/pear-MDB2_Driver_mysql) or
   PEAR::MDB2_Driver_pgsql (databases/pear-MDB2_Driver_pgsql), PHP
   Session (www/php5-session), and one of the PHP MySQL
   (databases/php5-mysql) or PHP Pgsql (databases/php5-pgsql)
   depending on your choice of backend database above.

   If you will be sending emails from Tinderbox (e.g. build
   failure or build completion emails) you must install net/p5-Net
   to get the Net::SMTP Perl module.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Installation

   Tinderbox now determines where to do all of its work relative
   to the location of the tc program, passed around to other
   functions by means of the ${pb} environmental variable (think:
   package build). Historically, this was the /space/ directory
   (tc was usually found in /space/scripts/tc).

   Henceforth, the top-level directory will be referred to as
   ${pb}, which you should substitute for whatever root directory
   you're using.
    1. Create directories ${pb} and ${pb}/scripts/.
    2. Extract the Tinderbox distribution into ${pb}/scripts/.
    3. Run tc to setup configuration files and initialize the
       Tinderbox database:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc Setup
       If you are going to be using the web front-end, edit
       webui/inc_ds.php.dist for your database setup. Then copy
       this file to inc_ds.php.
       If your Tinderbox host does not have administrative access
       to the database server, you must perform the next few steps
       by hand. Else, skip to step 7.
    4. Edit ${pb}/scripts/ds.ph.dist for your setup. Once this
       file has been edited, copy it to ds.ph.
    5. Create the database and database user on the host that you
       defined within ds.ph. Note: the database can live on the
       same server as Tinderbox. Just set $DB_HOST to localhost in
       ds.ph. The tinderbox user must be granted the following
       permissions on the Tinderbox database (for security
       purposes no other permissions should be granted) [MySQL
       only]:
          + Select_priv
          + Insert_priv
          + Update_priv
          + Delete_priv
       For PostgreSQL users, make sure the Tinderbox user owns the
       Tinderbox database as well as all the tables within that
       database.
    6. Populate the database with the Tinderbox schema:
       MySQL:
# cd sql
# ./genschema mysql | mysql -u{DB_ADMIN} -p -h {DB_HOST} {DB_NAME}
       PostgreSQL:
# cd sql
# ./genschema pgsql | psql -U {DB_USER} -W -h {DB_HOST} -d {DB_NAME}
       Where {DB_HOST} and {DB_NAME} are the values of $DB_HOST
       and $DB_NAME from ds.ph respectively, {DB_ADMIN} is the
       database administrator username, and {DB_USER} is the
       Tinderbox user. Note: do not do this if you are upgrading!
       If you do, you will overwrite all of your previous data. If
       schema changes are required for upgrading, a separate
       upgrade schema file will be included, and instructions will
       be available at http://tinderbox.marcuscom.com.
    7. Edit ${pb}/scripts/tinderbox.ph.dist for your environment
       (if you are using the web front-end, also edit
       webui/inc_tinderbox.php.dist). Once these files have been
       edited they must be copied to tinderbox.ph and
       inc_tinderbox.php respectively.
    8. Initialize the Tinderbox:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc init
    9. Tinderbox can use either NFS or nullfs to mount the
       required file systems within the build chroots (called
       Builds in Tinderbox). If you wish to use nullfs, skip to
       step 12.
   10. Setup the Tinderbox server as an NFS server by adding the
       following to /etc/exports:
${pb} -alldirs -maproot=0:0 localhost
       Note: ${pb} CANNOT be a symlink. It should be a real, fully
       qualified path (hint: use realpath on your desired ${pb} to
       find out what this needs to be).
   11. Add the following to /etc/rc.conf to enable the NFS client
       and server:
nfs_client_enable="YES"
nfs_server_flags="-u -t -n 20"
rpcbind_enable="YES"
nfs_server_enable="YES"
nfs_reserved_port_only="YES"
   12. Create the required Jails using the tc command. A Jail is
       nothing more than a version of FreeBSD. For example, to
       create a Jail for FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createJail -j 8.2 -d "FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE" \
        -t RELENG_8_2_0_RELEASE -u CVSUP
       or
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createJail -j 8.2 -d "FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE" \
        -t 8.2-RELEASE -u LFTP -H ftp.freebsd.org
       The first method will download source via cvsup and use
       make world to compile a complete FreeBSD installation.
       The second method will instead download binary release sets
       (used on CDs) and install them, making the process much
       shorter. As the command suggests, the second method
       requires lftp (ftp/lftp) to be installed. You need to
       specify what release (not the CVS tag, as opposed to the
       first method) you want to download with the -t option. Also
       note that you need to provide an FTP server to download the
       sets from (with the -H option).
       Note: all Jail names MUST begin with their FreeBSD major
       version number. That is, the following is an illegal jail
       name: "FreeBSD-8.2".
       Hint: It is recommended that the Jail begin with the
       FreeBSD major.minor version (i.e. "8.2-FreeBSD" instead of
       just "8-FreeBSD") as this may prove useful when using
       things such as Hooks (Section 8.8).
   13. Create the required PortsTrees using the tc command. A
       PortsTree is a set of ports you wish to build. A PortsTree
       does not have to be a complete FreeBSD ports tree. However,
       all ports within a tree must have all of their dependencies
       within the same tree.
       For example, to create a portstree that tracks the full
       FreeBSD ports tree:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createPortsTree -p FreeBSD \
        -d "FreeBSD ports tree" \
        -w http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/
   14. Create the required Builds using the tc command. A Build is
       a combination of a Jail and a PortsTree. The build is the
       object in which packages are created. To create a build
       that combines a 8.2 Jail with the FreeBSD ports tree:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createBuild -b 8.2-FreeBSD -j 8.2 \
        -p FreeBSD -d "8.2-RELEASE with FreeBSD ports tree"
       Note: the recommended way to name Builds is
       "Jail-PortsTree". All builds must also begin with their
       FreeBSD major version number.

   NOTE: The tc script uses cvsup12 as its default cvsup mirror.
   If you would like to use another server or enable cvsup
   compression use the -H and -C line arguments to the tc script
   respectively. For example, to use cvsup2.freebsd.org and enable
   cvsup compression for all Jail updates, use the following
   command:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc createJail -j 8-STABLE \
        -d "FreeBSD 8-STABLE" -t RELENG_8 -u CVSUP -C \
        -H cvsup2.freebsd.org

   TIP: It is possible to suppress spurious setuid warnings from
   periodic if ${pb} is on a dedicated partition. Simply add the
   nosuid flag to the partition; for UFS in /etc/fstab:
/dev/ad5s1f     /usr/local/tinderbox    ufs     rw,nosuid       1
1

   and for ZFS:
# zfs set setuid=off $(zfs list ${pb} | tail -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Upgrading

   Tinderbox may undergo a variety of changes between versions. In
   order to make sure your Tinderbox stays fully operational after
   copying over a new version's distribution, you should run the
   following command:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc Upgrade

   Note: This command may require administrative access to the
   database. If such access is not available from your Tinderbox
   host, you may have to load an upgrade schema file manually. The
   upgrade script will provide such instructions if needed.

   Tinderbox upgrades to 3.0 are supported only from Tinderbox
   2.4.x. If you are running a release prior to 2.4.0, you must
   first upgrade to the latest 2.4 release, then upgrade to 3.0.

   The 3.0 upgrade will migrate all data, configuration, and
   scripts from 2.x EXCEPT any customized port fail reasons and
   port fail patterns. These will have to be re-entered by hand
   after completing the 3.0 upgrade.

   CAVEAT: If you are doing a major upgrade (i.e. moving from one
   major version of Tinderbox to another), be sure to backup your
   database BEFORE running tc Upgrade. Major upgrades may drop and
   recreate the database, and this has the potential for data
   loss.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Using Tinderbox

   To run a Tinderbox build, and track the progress in the
   database, you must first add the port you wish to build to the
   database using the ${pb}/scripts/tc application:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addPort -b {BUILD} -d {PORT DIRECTORY}

   Where {BUILD} is the name of the Build for which this port
   should be built and {PORT DIRECTORY} is the directory within
   the PortsTree where this port can be found. For example, to
   build the GNOME 2 Desktop port for the Build "8.2-FreeBSD":
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addPort -b 8.2-FreeBSD -d x11/gnome2

   Note: a port does not have to be added to the database for
   Tinderbox to build it. If you just want to do a quick ad hoc
   port build, forgo the previously mentioned step.

   Note: in Tinderbox 2.x, addPort took a -r argument which
   resursively added ports to the datastore. In Tinderbox 3.0 and
   higher, this option is assumed. If you do not want to enable
   recursion, specify the -R argument to addPort.

   To start a Tinderbox build, use the tc command:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tinderbuild -b {BUILD} {PORT DIRECTORY}

   For example, to build the GNOME 2 Desktop for the Build
   8.2-FreeBSD:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tinderbuild -b 8.2-FreeBSD x11/gnome2

   TIP: The example above will run the build in the foreground
   with all messages and errors echoing to the terminal. To
   capture all of this, it is recommended to redirect tinderbuild
   output to a log file. For example:

     * Bourne shell equivalents:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tinderbuild -b 8.2-FreeBSD \
        x11/gnome2 > ${pb}/builds/8.2-FreeBSD/build.log 2>&1 &
     * C shell equivalents:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tinderbuild -b 8.2-FreeBSD \
        x11/gnome2 >& ${pb}/builds/8.2-FreeBSD/build.log &

   More advanced logging options are also available. All log files
   including tinderbuild output, make logs, and individual port
   build logs can be captured in one location. This location is
   specified by the LOG_DIRECTORY configuration option. By
   default, this option is unset meaning that logs will not be
   centralized. If set to a directory, a subdirectory will be
   created in the format of {BUILD}-{DATE} where {BUILD} is the
   Build name, and {DATE} is the date in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
   (e.g. 8.2-FreeBSD-20091012112105). Within this subdirectory
   will be the tinderbuild log, and symlinks to the make logs and
   individual port build logs. If you would rather have the log
   files copied to this location (instead of using symlinks), set
   the LOG_DOCOPY configuration option to "1".

   To manipulate the logging configuration, use the command
   ${pb}/scripts/tc configLog with the appropriate options. Those
   options are in Table 5-1.

   Table 5-1. configlog Options
   -d <directory> Set the logging directory
   -D Unset the logging directory
   -c Set the LOG_DOCOPY option to 1 which will copy log files to
   the log directory instead of using symlinks
   -C Set the LOG_DOCOPY option to 0

   The tinderbuild function also accepts some additional commands,
   described in Table 5-2.

   Table 5-2. tinderbuild Commands
  -init           updates the Jail then updates the Build
  -nullfs         uses nullfs instead of NFS to mount Jail and PortsTree
                  file systems
  -cleanpackages  removes all packages already built fors the
                  specified Build
  -updateports    updates the Build's PortsTree (NOTE: dangerous if
                  doing parallel runs with the same PortsTree)
  -skipmake       skips the Makefile generation stage (NOTE: only use
                  this option if a good Makefile already exists)
  -noduds         skips the duds file generation stage (NOTE: packages
                  which are forbidden or ignored will be built)
  -noclean        does not clean up the Build hierarchy after the port
                  build completes
  -plistcheck     makes any plist verification problems (e.g.
                  leftover files) fatal
  -cleandistfiles removes all files and directories in the
                  distfile cache prior to starting the build
  -fetch-original ignores the distfile cache, and fetches all
                  distfiles from their respective sources
  -nolog          disables log analysis code
  -onceonly       only performs one build pass (i.e. tinderbuild Phase
                  1)
  -norebuild      do not force a rebuild of packages specified on the
                  command line
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Maintenance

   To obtain the version of Tinderbox, run the command:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tbversion

   This command simply cats the .version file in ${pb}. The
   .version file is created during distfile generation. If the
   contents of the Tinderbox distribution are copied to another
   location, make sure that the .version file is copied as well.

   To update existing Jails:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc makeJail -j 8.2

   The output of the Jail build will go to stdout. The output of
   the update command (e.g. cvsup) will go to
   ${pb}/jails/{JAIL}/update.log (where {JAIL} is the name of the
   Jail in question).

   To update existing PortsTrees, use the tc (Tinderbox
   Controller) application with the updatePortsTree command. For
   example:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc updatePortsTree -p FreeBSD

   If you want to clone various aspects of an existing Build, use
   the tc application with the copyBuild command. For example:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc copyBuild -s 8.2-FreeBSD -d 9-FreeBSD

   The source and destination Builds (i.e. 8.2-FreeBSD and
   9-FreeBSD respectively in this example) must already exist. By
   default, copyBuild will copy the environment file, OPTIONS, and
   ports from the source Build to the destination Build. It can
   also optionally copy ccache data and packages. The options
   supported by copyBuild are in Table 6-1.

   Table 6-1. copyBuild Options
   -s Source Build name
   -d Destination Build name
   -c (optional) copy ccache data
   -E (optional) do NOT copy environment files
   -O (optional) do NOT copy OPTIONS data
   -P (optional) do NOT copy ports
   -p (optional) copy packages (including last build status,
      version, and size)

   To remove a Build, use the tc application with the rmBuild
   command, followed by removal of all directories created for the
   build:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc rmBuild -b {BUILD}
# for dir in "" builds errors logs options packages ; \
        do rm -r ${pb}/$dir/{BUILD} ; done

   After a Build has been removed, you may also wish to remove the
   PortsTree and Jail:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc rmPortsTree -p {PORTSTREE}
# rm -r ${pb}/portstrees/{PORTSTREE}
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc rmJail -j {JAIL}
# rm -r ${pb}/jail/{JAIL}

   Over time, Builds may become cluttered with old log files and
   packages. To cleanup old, unreferenced, files, use the
   ${pb}/scripts/tc application with the tbcleanup command:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tbcleanup

   The tbcleanup command supports a few arguments which will tell
   it to perform additional cleanups, described in Table 6-2.

   Table 6-2. tbcleanup Options
   -d Cleanup unreferenced distfiles from the distfile cache
   -E Do NOT remove old error logs (regular port build logs are
      still removed)
   -p Cleanup stale packages

   If you want to terminate a running tinderbuild, run the
   command:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tbkill -b {BUILD}

   This will gracefully terminate a running tinderbuild for Build
   {BUILD}. If you want to force the tinderbuild to die, then
   specify the kill signal:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc tbkill -b BUILD -s 9

   Note: It may take a few minutes after executing a graceful
   termination of the tinderbuild before all processes exit. This
   is because the processes are cleaning up the build environment.
   If, after five minutes, the build is still running, then you
   should consider killing it with signal 9.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Troubleshooting

   If you encounter problems with Tinderbox, it helps to see what
   is going on inside a Build. Tinderbox operational logs can be
   found under ${pb}/builds/{BUILD} (where {BUILD} is the Build
   name). This is where tinderbuild output should be redirected
   (see Chapter 5. The make.0 and make.1 logs contain the initial
   buildsetup for each port. The reason there are two logs is that
   tinderbuild runs in two phases. The second build phase is
   identical to the first, and is run to catch any transient
   problems that may have occurred in the first phase.

   The full build log of each port will be copied to
   ${pb}/logs/{BUILD} (where {BUILD} is the Build name). If the
   port failed to build successfully, the log will also be copied
   to ${pb}/errors/{BUILD} (where {BUILD} is the Build name).

   Sometimes, the log alone is not sufficient for figuring out why
   a port failed to build. In such cases, one must also see the
   port's work directory. To have Tinderbox save this, create an
   empty file called .keep in the port's directory, and the work
   directory will be tarred, compressed, and copied to
   ${pb}/wrkdirs/{BUILD} (where {BUILD} is the Build name).

   When it becomes too difficult to figure out the problem based
   on the wrkdir, it may become necessary to access the Build
   itself. To do this, touch a file called .sleepme in the port's
   directory. The moment the .sleepme file is detected by the
   build system, the port build will suspend just before executing
   "make build". You can access the Build with the command:
# ./tc enterBuild -b {BUILD} -d {PORT_DIRECTORY}

   When you have finished, remove the .sleepme file, and the port
   build will continue.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Advanced Topics

8.1. Alternative Means of Creating Jail Sources and PortsTrees

   By default, Jails and PortsTrees are updated using csup
   (/usr/bin/csup). Every time a new Jail or PortsTree is created,
   they will inherit the default update type. This update type is
   stored in ${pb}/scripts/etc/env/GLOBAL as defaultUpdateType.
   The allowed values are CVSUP, CSUP, LFTP, USER, and NONE. For
   CVSUP and CSUP there is also a defaultUpdateHost. This can also
   be changed in ${pb}/scripts/etc/env/GLOBAL.

   A Jail or PortsTree's update type can also be set when creating
   the Jail or PortsTree. To do this, specify the -u option to the
   appropriate create command. If the value of the update type is
   CVSUP, then /usr/local/bin/cvsup will be used to update the
   Jail or PortsTree. If the value is NONE, then no updates can be
   performed once the Jail or PortsTree is created. Instead, it is
   assumed these trees already exist in the appropriate format.

   If the value is USER, then an update.sh script must be created
   under the Jail or PortsTree's root directory. This script will
   be called when an update is required. For example, if you have
   a Jail called "8.2", an executable update.sh script must be
   placed under ${pb}/jails/8.2. If you have a PortsTree called
   "FreeBSD", an executable update.sh script must be placed under
   ${pb}/portstrees/FreeBSD.
     __________________________________________________________

8.2. Alternative Mounting

   If you want to mount /ports inside your PortsTree or /src
   inside your Jail via nullfs or NFS from another location, use
   -m switch to create.

   Examples for NFS:
# ./tc createPortsTree -p FreeBSD -m server:/directory
# ./tc createJail -j 8-FreeBSD -m server:/directory

   Examples for nullfs:
# ./tc createPortsTree -p FreeBSD -m /directory
# ./tc createJail -j 8-FreeBSD -m /directory

   Tinderbuild will ensure that these file systems are correctly
   mounted so you do not need to mount them by your own before
   calling tinderbuild.

   If you want to change these settings later, use:
# ./tc setPortsMount -p {portstreename} -m {mount path}
# ./tc setSrcMount -j {jailname} -m {mount path}
     __________________________________________________________

8.3. Distfile Caching

   Caching distfiles in a local repository can greatly improve
   build times, and in cases where downloading a particular port
   is only necessary for a new build, can reduce bandwidth. As
   long as there is sufficient disk space, enabling a local
   distfile cache can be accomplished by one of the following
   commands:

   NFS:
# ./tc configDistfile -c localhost:${distfiles}

   nullfs:
# ./tc configDistfile -c ${distfiles}

   Where ${distfiles} is either an NFS mount point or, if using
   nullfs, a fully qualified path where distfiles should be
   stored.

8.4. Using Ccache

   Another excellent way of accelerating builds is to use the
   compiler cache, "ccache". To use ccache support, you must first
   create a tar file with ccache and various symlinks within a
   /opt/ directory. Your tarball contents should be:
opt
opt/ccache
opt/gcc -> ccache
opt/cc -> ccache
opt/g++ -> ccache
opt/c++ -> ccache

   This tarball must be called ccache.tar, and be placed in the
   Jail directory for each Jail that will use ccache (e.g.
   ${pb}/jails/8.2).

   Once the tarball is created, run (-e for enabling, -d for
   disabling, -c specifies directory, -s maximal size):
# ./tc configCcache -e -c /ccache -s 2G

   Then run your builds as you normally would. To debug ccache,
   add -l /ccache.log switch to the command.

   Then, in the root of each build directory, there will be a
   ccache.log that will let you know if the cache is working.

8.5. Customizing the Environment

   It is possible to export environment variables on a global,
   per-Jail, per-PortsTree, and/or per-Build basis. This is done
   by creating a file named GLOBAL, jail.{JAIL},
   portstree.{PORTSTREE}, or build.{BUILD} respectively, and
   placing it in ${pb}/scripts/etc/env/.

   For example, if you want a particular Build (e.g. "8.2-Perl56")
   to use Perl 5.6.2 instead of Perl 5.8.x, create a file named
   build.8.2-Perl56 in ${pb}/scripts/etc/env/ that contains the
   following:
PERL_VER=5.6.2
PERL_VERSION=5.6.2

   Likewise, if you want to enable debugging for a particular
   PortsTree (e.g. "FreeBSD-debug"), create the following
   portstree.FreeBSD-debug in ${pb}/scripts/etc/env/:
CFLAGS="-O -g -pipe"
STRIP=
     __________________________________________________________

8.6. Updating port properties

   Every time "./tc addPort" is called, it will determine if a
   port is already present in the datastore. If it is, the port's
   properties (i.e. MAINTAINER, COMMENT, etc.) are updated. If you
   just want rescan all of the ports currently in the datastore,
   and update their properties, use the command "./tc
   rescanPorts". It accepts many of the same options as addPort.
     __________________________________________________________

8.7. Configuring port OPTIONS

   It is possible to manipulate port OPTIONS on a per-Build basis.
   To do this, create a directory under which all build OPTIONS
   sub-directories will go (e.g. ${pb}/options/). For each Build
   that you wish to use to use OPTIONS, create a subdirectory
   named for that build (e.g. 8-STABLE-FreeBSD/). This directory
   should look like /var/db/ports/ in that it contains
   sub-directories for each OPTIONS-supporting port.

   For example, if you wanted to build net/wireshark with RTP
   support for the Build 8-STABLE-FreeBSD, you would have the
   following directory structure:
${pb}/options/8-STABLE-FreeBSD/wireshark/options

   The contents of the wireshark/options file would be:
_OPTIONS_READ=wireshark-0.99.4
WITH_RTP=true
WITH_SNMP=true
WITH_ADNS=true
WITH_PCRE=true

   Once this structure is setup, then enable OPTIONS support in
   Tinderbox, and specify the path to the OPTIONS directory
   structure:
# ./tc configOptions -e
# ./tc configOptions -o /options

   The configOptions command takes the arguments described in
   Table 8-1.

   Table 8-1. configOptions arguments
   -e enable OPTIONS support
   -d disable OPTIONS support
   -o set an OPTIONS source directory tree

   If you would like to interactively choose OPTIONS for your
   ports, specify the -o option to "./tc addPort". This will
   perform a make config on all ports, displaying the ncurses
   OPTIONS dialog. All OPTIONS settings will be automatically
   saved to the correct location. Each time addPort or rescanPorts
   is run with the -o flag, all existing OPTIONS settings will be
   purged. If you want to retain existing OPTIONS, use the -O flag
   instead.
     __________________________________________________________

8.8. Using Hooks

   A Hook is a "callout" which gives Tinderbox the ability to run
   custom code at pre-determined times. For example, you can
   establish a Hook to run just before a Port is built, after a
   Build is extracted, before a PortsTree is updated, etc.
   Pre-condition hooks can even cause an operation to terminate if
   so desired. To see a list of all available Hooks:
# ./tc listHooks

   To add a new command for an existing Hook, use:
# ./tc updateHookCmd -h {hook} -c {command}

   To disable a Hook:
# ./tc updateHookCmd -h {hook} -c ""

   (note: The null string after the -c option disables the Hook).

   There is no way to add new Hooks dynamically. However, if you
   have an idea for a new Hook, please contact
   tinderbox-list@marcuscom.com.

   An example use for a Hook could be to restrict the number of
   CPUs used when building:
# ./tc updateHookCmd -h postJailExtract -c 'echo MAKE_JOBS_NUMBER=2 >> $
{DESTDIR}/etc/make.conf'

8.9. Creating Users

   To use tinderd scheduling via the web you must first create a
   User:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addUser -u {USER} -e {EMAIL} -p {PASSWORD} -w

   (Where {USER} is a username, {EMAIL} is the user's email
   address, and {PASSWORD} is the user's password for Tinderbox
   web access.)

   If you want to enable web access for a previously created user,
   you must update that user's account to give them a password as
   well as web access:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc updateUser -u {USER} -e {EMAIL} -p {PASSWORD}
 -w

   (Where {USER} is a username, {EMAIL} is the user's email
   address, and {PASSWORD} is the user's password for Tinderbox
   web access.)

   Then you have to define one web administrator who has full
   rights on all Builds and is the only account that can add other
   users:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc setWwwAdmin -u {USER}

   (Where {USER} is the web administrator's username.)

   After that, just browse to your Tinderbox web site with your
   web browser and login with {USER} and {PASSWORD}. You can now
   create and modify other users easily by using the "Add User" or
   "Modify User" links.
     __________________________________________________________

8.10. Automating/Queuing Port Builds

   If you want to use Tinderbox to test many different ports one
   after the other you probably want tinderd. tinderd runs as a
   daemon and looks to see if something was added to the "ports to
   build queue". You can add different ports for different builds
   with different priorities. tinderd will automatically pick up
   the port with the highest priority and starts building it. That
   repeats until the queue is empty. After the queue empties
   tinderd will sleep for a configurable amount of time (default:
   120 seconds) thereafter it starts searching for new queue
   entries again. If you need tinderd to check the queue before
   the sleep timer has expired, send the tinderd process a SIGHUP:
# kill -HUP {PID of tinderd}

   Where {PID of tinderd} is the process ID of the tinderd script
   as seen in the output of ps.

   You can start tinderd (it will stay in foreground by default).
   If you want to run tinderd automatically when the system boots,
   copy the included ${pb}/etc/rc.d/tinderd script to
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/. Be sure to check out the various rc.conf
   variables documented in this script before using it. If you
   installed Tinderbox using the port then the script will have
   been installed for you as tinderbox.

   NOTE: the script used to be called tinderd.sh. If you have a
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tinderd.sh script, delete it, then copy the
   new tinderd script to the rc.d/ directory.

   Now use:
# cd ${pb}/scripts && ./tc addBuildPortsQueueEntry -b {BUILD} \
        -d {PORT DIRECTORY}

   To add a port to the queue for tinderd to automatically pick
   up, run a tinderbuild on it, and delete the entry after
   tinderbuild completion.

   (Where {BUILD} is a Build name, and {PORT DIRECTORY} is a
   directory under {BUILDS}'s PortsTree (e.g. x11/gnome2).)

   If the addBuildPortsQueueEntry command is run without the -d
   argument, then all ports for the specified {BUILD} will be
   added to the queue.

8.11. Running Tinderbox in a Jail

   Tinderbox can be run in a FreeBSD jail with some concessions.

   Since neither NFS nor nullfs (at the time of writing) are
   usable in a jail, we cannot simply install and use as normal.
   Instead, we simply use a chroot.
    1. Create a jail for your Tinderbox using the instructions in
       the FreeBSD Handbook.
    2. Install dependencies into the jail (Chapter 2).
    3. Install Tinderbox (in the jail):
# mkdir ${pb}
# cd ${pb} && \
        fetch -o - path_to_tinderbox-x.x.tar.gz | \
        tar xvzf -
    4. Now we need to leave the jail, and on the host system
       chroot into it:
# chroot ${jail_dir} /bin/csh
       Now follow from step 3 in Chapter 3.
    5. Copy ${jail_dir}/${pb}/scripts/etc/rc.d/tinderd to
       /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
    6. Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf (again, in the host
       system):
tinderd_enable= "YES"
tinderd_chroot= "${jail_dir}"
tinderd_directory=    "${pb}"
tinderd_flags=  "-nullfs"
    7. Install a web server of your choice in the jail, and follow
       the webserver setup.

   All administration and use of the Tinderbox must now be done
   from the host system, by using chroot into ${jail_dir}.
